ACJ_carboncycle_2015.R
	flf() = fine litterfall
	
PED: 2009 - 2011
	karl going back to raw stuff for this interval for all non acj/pan plots
	
acj/pan are done from 2013

leave out TRU04 until cecile/karl have it together
	talk to besit - she's working on tru04 & acj/pan
	cecile is halfway there for tru04
	
NPPacw_census() - living woody biomass
	non dendrometers
	
NPPacw small trees - works, but data isn't clean
	ask besit or walter to look into it maybe
	basically, look how they clean data for census, and do the same for small trees

 NPPacw dendrometer bands - scale from annual acw to seasonal (3 mos) acw
	use census data to scale up
	
NPP_CWD - not done, and not done for PED either.
	these are branchfall transects

NPProots_IC(NPProot_2015_CG) - ingrowth cores
	nostock means the first meas is subtracted

soilrespiration() 
	this probably doesn't work yet
	
stemrespiration - works fine

leafrespiration - not yet

look at yad's synthesis table for overall point of reference
